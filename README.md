## Introduction

In the world of advertising, understanding the effectiveness and impact of different ad types is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies. This project aims to provide insights into ad performance by employing clustering techniques to segment ads based on various features. By categorizing ads into meaningful groups, marketers can tailor their strategies to specific audience segments and improve overall campaign efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises the following features:
- Timestamp
- InventoryType
- Ad Length
- Ad Width
- Ad Size
- Ad Type
- Platform
- Device Type
- Format
- Available Impressions
- Matched Queries
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Spend
- Fee
- Revenue
- CTR (Click-Through Rate)
- CPM (Cost Per Mille)
- CPC (Cost Per Click)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Prior to clustering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. This step involved data cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.

## Clustering

Two clustering techniques were employed to segment the ads:

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering involves creating a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting groups based on similarity. A dendrogram was plotted to visualize the hierarchical structure of the data and aid in determining the optimal number of clusters.

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering aims to partition data into K clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, followed by the application of K-Means to group ads based on their features.

## Results

The clustering results provide valuable insights into the segmentation of advertisements. By categorizing ads into clusters, we can identify similarities and differences among various ad types, allowing for more targeted and effective marketing strategies.

## Repository Structure

```
- data/
  - advertisement_data.csv (or other dataset files)
- notebooks/
  - EDA.ipynb
  - Clustering.ipynb
- README.md

```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks for EDA and clustering.
3. Ensure the required Python libraries are installed (listed in the notebooks).
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
